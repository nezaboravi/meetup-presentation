                The language barrier was real - my English vocabulary was limited to "Hi", "No", and "Yes.". 
                But at that time i have been discovering the world of internet. Did not know how to use it. Did not have a computer. My older sister had one i could use while she was at work.
                I was so naive. I thought that Hotmail is, you know? Expected to see some 'hot' chicks on there.
                Then i start to read how websites are made. I had Serbian/English dictionary, it is a real FAT book. 
                SO i started translating. I was so excited. I wanted to learn how to make websites.

                    After my day job, I'd spend hours learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Been working all day, bartending, painting, building, and i was so tired. 
                    In a few hours in night i was learning how to make websites.

                    My first website was built with Microsoft FrontPage. 
                    Dreamweaver was too advanced for me.
                    The moment I published it, I knew I had found my passion.
                    This is the moment when i knew that i will be a developer, and this is the best website presentation i ever made.

                Despite the language barrier and late nights, I was hooked. The combination of creativity and logic in web development was exactly what I had been searching for. Little did I know, this was just the beginning of an incredible journey that would lead me to Laravel and beyond.
