        <p class="leading-relaxed">
            I spent four intense years in military school, where discipline and structure shaped much of who I am. After that, I served in the army for thirteen years as a professional officer—gaining experience, resilience, and a deep understanding of responsibility and leadership. Those years taught me how to handle pressure, adapt quickly, and never give up, no matter the challenge.
