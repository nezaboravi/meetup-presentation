            I've been writing code for 25 years. But that's not how my story began.

            Before Laravel, before PHP, I was a soldier.

             Then a wall painter.
            </p>
            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                Then a construction worker.
            </p>
            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                My path to becoming a developer was anything but Typical.

            I'm a father of three, grandfather of two, and husband to one amazing woman. I'm a Laravel developer, a big fan of the framework, and even bigger fan of the community around it. As the organizer of Laravel Serbia, I'm excited to help grow our local community—starting with our very first Laravel Serbia Meetup.            </p>
